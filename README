== LZTestKit

This package extends lzunit with behavioral testing, asynchronous
testing, and automated execution of a series of test applets.

* Behavioral testing implements mocks, stubs, and expectations.  It's
  a loose port of rspec to OpenLaszlo.

* Asynchronous testing allows you to write a test case that isn't
  considered complete when it returns.  If a test case creates a
  callback function, the test case is only complete when the callback
  function returns.  (Except if the callback function creates a
  callback function, etc.)

* Automated test execution runs all the test applets in a directory,
  in series, in a single browser window, stopping if one of them has
  an error.  It allows you to run all of a package's test cases from
  the browser by visiting a single url, instead of clicking on each
  one in turn.

== Requirements
* OpenLaszlo 3.4+ or 4.0.6+.  (Earlier versions might work, but aren't tested.)
