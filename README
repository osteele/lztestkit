== LZTestKit

This package extends lzunit with behavioral testing, asynchronous
testing, test selection, and automated test sequencing.

* Test selection runs a single test case within a test applet, without
  modifying the sources.  (You supply the name of the test case as a
  query parameter in the application URL.)  It allows you to use your
  test applet as your debugging scaffolding, without running a lot of
  code that you aren't interested in.

* Automated test sequencing runs all the test applets in a directory,
  in series, in a single browser window, stopping if one of them has
  an error.  It allows you to run all of a package's test cases from
  the browser by visiting a single url, instead of navigating to each
  url in turn.

* Behavioral testing implements mocks, stubs, and expectations.  It allows
  you to *test* one class, while *stubbing* the classes that it depends on.
  You can even verify that the tested class makes functions that you expect
  it to.  This a loose port of rspec to OpenLaszlo.

* Asynchronous testing allows you to write a test case that isn't
  considered complete when it returns.  If a test case creates a
  callback function, the test case is only complete when the callback
  function returns.  (Except if the callback function creates a
  callback function, etc.)

== Requirements

This package requires OpenLaszlo 3.4.0 or 4.0.6.  (Others versions
might work, but aren't tested.)

== Test selection



== Automated test sequencing execution

autorun-lz.js implements the OpenLaszlo side of automated execution;
autorun-browser.js implements browser support; and autorun-include.jsp
is a JSP include that lists the files in the current directory for the
browser-side code to look at.

Copy test/autorun/index.jsp into your test directory, and update the
includes at the top of the file to reflect the paths to the lztestkit
src and lib subdirectories.  By default, this file will run files in
its directory that match /test-*.lzx/; this is a configuration
parameter that it should be obvious how to change.

Each test cases should include autorun-lz.js via <script
src="autorun-lz.js"/>.  If you have a library.lzx file with test
scaffolding, you can place that directive there.

== Behavioral testing

TODO

Let's you writing things like this in a test case:
  calling(anObject, 'methodName', 'arg1')
    .should.call(otherObject, 'method', 'some', 'arguments')
    .and.send(anObject, 'onchange', 'data')
    .and.returnWith(1)

  constructing('MyClass', 'initarg')
    .should.call(otherObject, 'method', 'some', 'arguments')


lzmock.js
lzspec.js
lzunit-extensions.js -- adds assertNotEquals, assert[Not]Contains, and assertFasterThan to TestCase
jsspec.js -- js-level support for lzspec (without OpenLaszlo dependencies)
hopkit.js -- support file for jsspec and lzmock

== Asynchronous testing

For now, see test/test-lzunit-async.lzx.  The new methods are also copiously documented

== Other Files

The browser support for autorun relies on jquery and swfobject.  I've
included versions of these in the file.

The behavioural testing files use hopkitjs to define chains.  It's not
necessary to use this file directly.
